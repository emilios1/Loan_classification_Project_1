Loan Classification Project 1.
The purpose of this project is to predict loan defaults. The data was obtained from the Lending Club website. Data cleaning was performed to fill in missing values, drop irrelavent columns, and generate features for analysis using Pandas. The data was explored, visualized, and analyzed using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Machine learning models were built and optimized using Numpy, SciPy, and SK Learn. 

Logistic regression and random forest models were trained on a training set, optimized using cross validation and grid search techniques, evaluated for over/ under fitting, and validated using a test set. The optimized logistic regression model has a percision of 0.99 and a recall  of 0.81. The random forest model has a precision of 0.99 and a recall of 0.84. Look at the Machine Learning Notebook, Updated 6-2-19 for more information concerning the predictive models.    

This repository also contains neural networks with 98% accuracy.
