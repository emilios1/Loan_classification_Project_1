Loan Classification Project 1.
The purpose of this project is to predict loan defaults. The data was obtained from the Lending Club website. Data cleaning was performed to fill in missing values, drop irrelavent columns, and generate features for analysis using Pandas. The data was explored, visualized, and analyzed using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Feature selection was performed analyzing multicolinarity and variation of feature variables. Machine learning models were built and optimized using Numpy, SciPy, and SK Learn. 

Logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine models were trained on a training set, optimized using cross validation and grid search techniques, and validated using a test set. The optimized logistic regression has precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.73. The SVM models has percision of 0.81 and a recall  of 0.80. The random forest model has a precision of 1.00 and a recall of 0.61.    

This repository also contains neural networks with 0.95 accuracy.
